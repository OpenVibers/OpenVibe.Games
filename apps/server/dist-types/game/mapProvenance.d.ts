/**
 * Which live entity a map-authored object owns.
 *
 * The old rule was spatial: "a resource node of this type within one metre"
 * (props: two metres). Proximity is not identity, and it was wrong in every
 * direction at once —
 *
 *  - two authored objects standing close together collapsed into one, so the
 *    second was silently dropped on every save;
 *  - a player's crate dropped beside an authored one suppressed the authored
 *    one, and could itself be despawned when that map object was deleted;
 *  - moving a seed further than the radius spawned a duplicate and left the
 *    original behind, losing whatever had been mined out of it.
 *
 * Every entity a map object authors carries that object's stable id, so the
 * question "is this mine?" is answered by provenance and nothing else.
 * Entities with no provenance are player-created and are never touched here:
 * player constructions are never deleted because a map seed disappeared.
 *
 * The planner is pure so both callers share one rule and it can be tested
 * without standing up physics.
