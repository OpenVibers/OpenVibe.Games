/**
 * The map-authored static collision layer, keyed by stable id.
 *
 * Both sides used to do `content.world.statics.push(...map.statics)` at boot.
 * That merge is permanent: the map layer could never be replaced, so a live
 * save added geometry the physics world never saw, moving a static changed
 * nothing until restart, and re-applying a map appended a second copy of
 * everything. The editor's Save button said "live" while most of the map
 * was not.
 *
 * Held separately and reconciled by id, statics appear, move and vanish on
 * save — and an identical repeated save touches no body at all, which matters
 * because the editor saves often and a heightfield rebuild is not free.
