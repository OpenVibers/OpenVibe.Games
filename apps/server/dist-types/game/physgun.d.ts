 * Physgun mechanics, server-authoritative.
 *
 * A grabbed dynamic body is driven toward a target point on the player's
 * view ray using velocity control (not teleportation), so it interacts
 * honestly with the rest of the physics world. Rotation offsets accumulate
 * from client intent commands but are applied here.
 *
 * This module is one *interaction* built on generic pieces (raycast, motion
 * control, zone rules); constraint tools (weld, rope, ...) will be siblings,
 * not extensions of a Physgun class.
