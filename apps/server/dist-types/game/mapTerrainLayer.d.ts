 * allocates, the editor saves constantly, and rendering and physics are
 * separate costs — only one of them moved.
 *
 * Reconciled by id, with the signature covering only what collision actually
 * depends on: a surface-only edit touches no body at all, a sculpt rebuilds
 * exactly the terrain that was sculpted, and an identical repeated save does
