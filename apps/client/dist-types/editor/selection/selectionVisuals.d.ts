/**
 * Everything that shows what is selected, in one place.
 *
 * The old code decided highlights from mesh identity, scattered across
 * `deselect()`, `select()`, five `selected*` variables and four `multi*`
 * arrays — so an undo, a remote merge or a material change (all of which
 * rebuild meshes) silently dropped the highlight, and a terrain's wireframe
 * flickered off whenever anything rebuilt.
 *
 * Here the visuals are derived from the selection SET and the view registry
 * every time they are recomputed. A mesh being rebuilt cannot lose a
 * highlight, because the highlight was never attached to the mesh.
 *
 * The five states are visually distinct on purpose:
 *   hover           pale blue outline
 *   local secondary warm amber
 *   local primary   strong orange (what the inspector is editing)
 *   remote selected the collaborator's colour
 *   remote locked   the collaborator's colour, plus a lock badge in the UI
