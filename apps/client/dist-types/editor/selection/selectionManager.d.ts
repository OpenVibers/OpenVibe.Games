/**
 * The editor's single selection authority.
 *
 * Selection is a set of **document ids**, never Babylon meshes: meshes are
 * transient projections that get rebuilt by undo, remote merges and material
 * changes, so anything holding a mesh reference goes stale. Ids survive all
 * of that, which is what lets undo/redo keep a selection alive.
 *
 * `primaryId` is the selection's anchor — the object whose values the
 * inspector shows, and the one drawn in the strong highlight colour. It is
 * always a member of `selectedIds` (or null when the set is empty).
