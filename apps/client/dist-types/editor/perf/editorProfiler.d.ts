/**
 * Counters and timers for the editor's hot paths.
 *
 * The point is that performance claims can be checked instead of asserted.
 * Every optimisation in the editor is justified by a number this produces on
 * a large map, and the same numbers are asserted in the E2E profile check so
 * a regression fails a gate rather than being noticed a year later.
 *
 * Counting must be cheaper than what it measures: a `Map` lookup and an add.
 * `time()` uses `performance.now()`, so it is only used around work that is
 * already at least microseconds (a serialize, a full rebuild) — never per
 * mesh.
