/**
 * Client half of the editing locks. The SERVER arbitrates — this only asks,
 * tracks what it was granted, and makes the answer visible.
 *
 * The rules that matter:
 *  - Hovering never acquires anything. Locks follow intent to EDIT, not
 *    attention, or moving the mouse across a busy map would lock it solid.
 *  - A group edit is ALL OR NOTHING. A transform that could only move half
 *    its members is worse than one that does not start.
 *  - Read-only selection of a locked object is fine; mutation is refused.
 *  - Losing a lease mid-gesture cancels the gesture back to its exact start,
 *    rather than leaving half-applied local state the server disagrees with.
