/**
 * The editor's live channel: presence, remote selection, locks, and the push

 *
 * Speaks `@openvibe/protocol`'s editor messages, decoded rather than cast. The
 * previous version of this file and the server had drifted apart — no
 * `hello`, a tag the server never sent, no camera stream — so collaboration
 * silently did nothing at all.
 *
 * The server assigns the peer id and colour and owns the lock table. A client
 * that could choose its own identity could impersonate another editor's
 * selection, and one that granted its own locks would not have a lock.
