/**
 * The workspace shell: a toolbar, three columns and a dock, all resizable,
 * collapsible and remembered.
 *
 * What it replaces: one fixed 270px sidebar overlaying the canvas, with a
 * collapse button that hid itself along with the panel. Collapsing produced
 * horizontal overflow, and the control that would have expanded it again was
 * inside the thing that had just gone. That class of bug is structural, so
 * the fix is structural: the collapse control lives in a RAIL that is always
 * present, and the layout is a grid whose columns can go to zero without the
 * body ever gaining a scrollbar.
