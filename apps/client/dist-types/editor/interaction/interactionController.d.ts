/**
 * One authoritative viewport interaction state machine.
 *
 * The rule this exists to enforce: ONE pointer gesture performs ONE editor
 * action. A gizmo drag is not also a selection; a camera orbit is not also a
 * selection; a sculpt stroke never becomes a click. Previously that was
 * approximated with a `gizmoDragging` boolean, `gizmo.isHovered` and a 50ms
 * timeout — three racing signals with no ownership guarantee.
 *
 * Here, a gesture is *claimed* on pointer-down and stays claimed until
 * pointer-up. Everything else asks `canStartGesture()` / `is()` instead of
 * guessing from stale hover flags.
