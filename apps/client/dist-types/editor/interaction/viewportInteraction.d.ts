/**
 * What a press on the canvas means, given the active tool.
 *
 * One place decides: select, place, sculpt, paint or face-pick. Every branch
 * asks `InteractionController` first, so a gesture the gizmo or the camera
 * already owns can never also do something here — which is the whole
 * click-through story, expressed once rather than as a hover flag per
 * handler.
