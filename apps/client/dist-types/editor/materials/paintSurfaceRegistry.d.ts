/**
 * Live paint state, keyed by (object id, surface id).
 *
 * Terrain used to keep its one mask on `TerrainView`, and the whole paint
 * path was written against that: pick a terrain, reach into the view, stamp
 * its mask. Nothing else could be painted because nothing else had one.
 *
 * A box has six independently paintable faces, a cylinder and a sphere have
 * their own wraps, and an imported model has a slot per material — so a mask
 * belongs to a SURFACE, not to a view, and the pair (owner, surface) is the
 * key. That pair is also what history and the save path address, so a stroke
 * is undoable and persistable without anything having to know which kind of
 * object it landed on.
 *
 * The registry holds runtime state only. The authored data — layers, tints,
 * the mask's URL — lives in the document, as always.
