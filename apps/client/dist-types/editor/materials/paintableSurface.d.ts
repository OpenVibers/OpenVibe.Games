/**
 * Painting, generalised past terrain.
 *
 * Terrain paint worked because a heightfield has one obvious UV
 * parameterisation: local metres map linearly to the mask. A box has six
 * faces that should be paintable independently, a cylinder wraps, a sphere
 * has poles, and an imported GLB may have no usable UVs at all. Rather than
 * a branch per case in the brush, each paintable thing answers the same two
 * questions:
 *
 *   - which surface am I? (a stable id, so the paint can be saved)
 *   - where in my mask is this world-space point?
 *
 * The DOCUMENT holds the surface data. A `PaintableSurface` is a view onto
 * it, exactly like the meshes are.
