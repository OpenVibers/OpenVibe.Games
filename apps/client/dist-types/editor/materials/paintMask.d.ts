/**
 * The paintable RGBA coverage mask behind a layered surface.
 *
 * Each of the four channels is one paint layer's coverage, so a brush stroke
 * writes to a single channel and cannot disturb the others — or the base
 * texture, which lives outside the mask entirely.
 *
 * Undo stores the changed RECTANGLE, not a whole-canvas snapshot: a small
 * stroke on a 512² mask costs a few KB instead of a megabyte, which is what
 * keeps the history memory budget realistic for painting.
