/**
 * The ONE place document objects become Babylon meshes, and the ONE place a
 * picked mesh becomes a document id.
 *
 * Before this the editor kept five parallel `Map<Mesh, T>` tables plus a
 * `terrainTargets` array, and every one of them had to be kept in step by
 * hand: `deselect()` cleared some, a remote merge disposed others, undo
 * rebuilt a mesh and left a third pointing at a disposed one. Meshes are a
 * PROJECTION — they are rebuilt constantly — so nothing durable may point at
 * them. Selection, history, locks and the Outliner all hold ids; this maps
 * between the two and nothing else does.
 *
 * A view owns its meshes, materials and editor-only helper geometry, and is
 * responsible for keeping them in sync with the document object. Destroying
 * and rebuilding one cannot invalidate identity.
