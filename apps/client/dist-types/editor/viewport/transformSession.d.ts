/**
 * One transform gesture, from grab to commit.
 *
 * Replaces the previous workflow of parenting heterogeneous Babylon meshes to
 * a pivot TransformNode, dragging it, unparenting, and then baking each object
 * type back by hand in `bakeMulti()` — which had a separate branch per kind,
 * silently skipped scale for anything but statics, and read the CURRENT mesh
 * pose (already transformed) as its source.
 *
 * Here the session owns immutable START snapshots and recomputes every member
 * from them on each update, so a drag cannot compound, cancel is exact, and
 * the whole gesture commits as a single history entry.
