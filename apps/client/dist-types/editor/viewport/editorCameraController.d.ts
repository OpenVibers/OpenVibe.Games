/**
 * Editor navigation.
 *
 * Babylon's own camera inputs are cleared: they fight the editor's action
 * system for the same keys and cannot be remapped, and their wheel handler
 * dollies along the view axis regardless of what is under the cursor. All
 * movement comes from here, driven by the centralised bindings.
 *
 * Three rules the previous handling broke:
 *  - MMB uses POINTER CAPTURE, so a drag keeps working past the canvas edge
 *    and the browser's middle-click autoscroll never appears.
 *  - Nothing moves while another gesture owns the pointer, so a gizmo drag
 *    cannot also orbit the camera.
 *  - The wheel zooms toward what is UNDER the cursor, not toward the centre
 *    of the screen, and scales its step by distance so approaching a small
 *    object does not overshoot it.
