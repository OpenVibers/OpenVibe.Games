/**
 * Placing things: the ghost preview, where a click lands, and what object
 * that becomes.
 *
 * Two behaviours worth naming:
 *
 * The BLANK-MAP BOOTSTRAP. A brand-new map has no geometry, so a placement
 * ray hits nothing and the first object could never be placed at all. When
 * the authored count is zero the first object commits at exactly the origin
 * wherever the user clicks — rather than the old answer, which was to keep a
 * hidden ground plane around purely so the ray had something to hit.
 *
 * SURFACE ALIGNMENT. A placed object's local +Y aligns to the surface normal,
 * so a box dropped on a slope sits on it rather than through it, and the
 * wheel yaw then turns it about that normal. Nodes, props and the spawn flag
 * stay upright regardless: a tree growing sideways out of a hill is never
 * what was meant.
