/**
 * Creating zones.
 *
 * Zones already had a schema, runtime rule application, a view (translucent
 * volume + wireframe), an Outliner entry and Inspector fields — everything
 * except a way to make one. So there was no path from an empty map to a zone
 * at all.
 *
 * A click makes a sensible axis-aligned volume centred on where you clicked,
 * selects it, and lets the ordinary move/scale gizmo do the rest: a zone's
 * scale IS its half-extent (see `editorObject.ts`), so resizing it with the
 * gizmo resizes the volume the rules apply in, not a mesh that then lies
 * about where they are.
