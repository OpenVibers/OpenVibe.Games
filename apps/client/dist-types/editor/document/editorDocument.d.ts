/**
 * EditorDocument — the ONE authority for map data in the editor.
 *
 * Before this, the editor held the map in six mutable arrays (`placedStatics`,
 * `placedNodes`, `placedProps`, `patches`, `mapLightsArr`, `mapZones`) plus a
 * copy of each object's transform on its Babylon mesh, plus another copy in
 * every undo entry. Nothing said which was true. A remote merge updated some;
 * a gizmo drag updated others; an undo restored a third set. Bugs of the form
 * "the inspector says 4 but the saved file says 2" are not fixable while that
 * is the shape of the code.
 *
 * So: the document owns map data, addressed by stable id. Babylon meshes are a
 * PROJECTION of it (see `viewport/editorViewRegistry.ts`), history stores
 * before/after document values (never mesh references or array indexes), and
 * selection stores ids. Destroying and rebuilding a mesh cannot invalidate
 * identity, history, locks, or selection, because none of them point at it.
 *
 * The document deliberately does NOT know about Babylon, the DOM, or the
 * server. It is a validated `MapFileV2` with an index and a change feed.
