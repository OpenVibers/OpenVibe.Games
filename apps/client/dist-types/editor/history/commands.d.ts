/**
 * The editor's commands, expressed against `EditorDocument`.
 *
 * These replace the `UndoOp` union and its 400-line `applyOp` switch. That
 * design stored Babylon `Mesh` references and live object references in undo
 * entries, so undoing a delete restored an object the meshes no longer knew
 * about, and every new feature meant a new variant plus a new branch that had
 * to remember to rebuild meshes, re-ground props and fix selection.
 *
 * A command here captures STABLE IDS and PLAIN VALUES — never a mesh, never a
 * live reference, never an array index. Applying one mutates the document;
 * views follow through the change feed on their own. Undo is therefore an
 * exact inverse by construction rather than by remembering to write the
 * mirror-image branch.
