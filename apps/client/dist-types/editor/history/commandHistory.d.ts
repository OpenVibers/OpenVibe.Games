/**
 * Undo/redo as a stack of COMMANDS, replacing the old `UndoOp` union.
 *
 * The union had one variant per mutation shape (23 of them) and one giant
 * `applyOp` switch that reached directly into editor closures. Every new
 * feature added a variant and a branch, and every branch had to remember to
 * rebuild meshes, re-ground props and fix up selection.
 *
 * A command instead owns its own execute/undo pair, so the history has no
 * knowledge of what is being changed. Two rules make it dependable:
 *
 *  - ONE user interaction produces ONE entry. A transaction groups the
 *    intermediate states of a drag or a numeric scrub into a single command.
 *  - Undo must be an exact inverse. `history.test.ts` asserts
 *    before → execute → undo deep-equals before for every command type.
