/**
 * Parametric low-poly humanoid rig.
 *
 * A joint hierarchy of TransformNodes with flat-shaded tapered-box segments
 * parented to them — no skinning, fully data-driven from Appearance.
 *
 * Assembly rules that keep the body seamless:
 *  - every segment's top extends PAST its joint (OVERLAP) into the segment
 *    above, so bending never exposes gaps or interior top faces;
 *  - adjoining segment widths match at the junction (thigh bottom == shin
 *    top, etc.) so silhouettes stay continuous;
 *  - thigh + shin + foot exactly total the leg length, so feet stand ON the
 *    ground instead of clipping through it.
 *
 * Conventions: root origin at the FEET (ground). +Z faces forward (player
 * yaw). Limb joints rotate at the top of their segment.
