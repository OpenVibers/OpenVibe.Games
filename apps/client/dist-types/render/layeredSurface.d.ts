/**
 * The renderer for a layered surface: one base texture plus up to four paint
 * layers blended by the RGBA channels of a single mask.
 *
 * Built on Babylon's `CustomMaterial`, which extends StandardMaterial and
 * lets us inject GLSL at `CUSTOM_FRAGMENT_UPDATE_DIFFUSE`. That matters:
 * lighting, shadows, fog and the day/night rig keep working exactly as they
 * do for every other surface in the game, and the SAME material class runs in
 * the editor and in play — so painting is WYSIWYG rather than an editor-only
 * approximation.
 *
 * Replaces TerrainMaterial, whose three diffuse slots were hard-wired to
 * grass/rock/mud and which had no concept of a base texture at all.
