/**
 * Crash/reload recovery for unsaved editor work.
 *
 * Everything the editor holds lives in one tab's memory until Save. Close it,
 * reload it, or crash the GPU process, and an afternoon of terrain sculpting
 * is gone — the `beforeunload` prompt is a warning, not a safety net.
 *
 * A draft is the map DOCUMENT (not Babylon objects, which are a projection of
 * it) written to browser-local durable storage a moment after you stop typing.
 * It is NEVER published to the server: publishing is what Save means, and a
 * crash recovering itself into everyone else's world would be worse than
 * losing the work. On startup, if a draft exists for THIS map at a revision
 * the editor recognises, the user is offered it.
 *
 * Storage is injected so the logic is testable without IndexedDB; the browser
 * binding is `indexedDbDraftStorage()` below.
