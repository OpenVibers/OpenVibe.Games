/**
 * The editor's ONE picking entry point.
 *
 * A selection gesture asks this once and gets a single front-most eligible
 * hit. It replaces the old sequence of "pick ordinary meshes, then separately
 * multiPick terrain, then prefer the smallest patch within 1.5m", which could
 * return several objects for one click and made overlapping terrain
 * unpredictable.
 *
 * Two Babylon traps are handled here so no caller can forget them:
 *
 *  1. `scene.pick(x, y, predicate)` SKIPS the built-in isPickable / isVisible
 *     / isEnabled checks when a predicate is supplied. Every predicate we
 *     build therefore re-tests them itself — a deleted (disabled) island used
 *     to stay invisibly selectable because of exactly this.
 *  2. Gizmo geometry lives in a UtilityLayerRenderer scene, so it is not in
 *     the main scene's pick set at all; ownership of a gizmo gesture is
 *     decided by the InteractionController, never by ray distance.
