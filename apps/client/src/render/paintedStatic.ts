/**
 * Rendering a painted static — the SAME interpretation in the editor and in
 * the game, so what an author paints is what players see.
 *
 * Three cases, because three shapes need different treatment:
 *
 *  - A BOX with per-face surfaces gets a MultiMaterial: one layered material
 *    per painted face, the ordinary style on the rest. Painting one wall must
 *    not restyle the other five.
 *  - A CYLINDER or SPHERE has one surface, so its material is simply the
 *    layered one.
 *  - An IMPORTED MODEL keeps its original glTF material and gets a transparent
 *    paint OVERLAY. Replacing a PBR material with a layered one would mean
 *    "painting a model" turned it grey everywhere the brush had not been,
 *    which is not painting, it is retexturing. The invariant is: where mask
 *    coverage is 0, the original asset shows through unchanged.
