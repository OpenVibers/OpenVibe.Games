/**
 * The game client's map layers, reconciled by stable id.
 *
 * A `map_reload` used to rebuild every category wholesale: dispose every
 * terrain mesh, every terrain collider, every map static, every map light,
 * and make them all again. Moving one box therefore re-parsed and re-uploaded
 * the geometry of the entire map to the GPU, and rebuilt collision the player
 * was standing on — which is visible as a hitch and, mid-jump, as a fall.
 *
 * The same `diffMapFileV2` the server uses says exactly what changed, and
 * `affectsCollision` says whether a change is appearance-only. Everything
 * here keys on the document's stable ids, so client rendering, client
 * prediction physics and server physics stay in agreement about which object
 * is which.
